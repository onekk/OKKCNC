<h2 style="color: blue; text-align: center"> OKKCNC Help File </h2>
</br>

<p>It was forked from bCNC to do some improvements that were not accepted
 upstream. </p>
  
<p>This help text is using tkhtmlview to permit a good visualization

 https://github.com/bauripalash/tkhtmlview/
 </p>


<p> The main reason to fork is the need of a more straight way to do some
 operations in my (almost) everyday hobbyst use of CNC </p>
 
<p>Most of the CAM plugins are not useful for me, as I use a proper CAM
 software. </p>
 
<p>Plus the interface to use the plugins are not very straightforward, so to 
accomplish some task it is more quick to modify the relevant information
in the CAM program, recreate GCode file and rerun the operation. </p>

<p>In the "Tools" page only the <b>Stock</b>, <b>Material</b> and <b>EndMill</b>
 databases are retained, more CAM operation could be added in future</p>
 
<p>I don't think this is the "only correct way" to do something, it is
 simply "my way" to do things.</p>


<p> Main improvements are:

<h3>CAM buttons</h3>
Added some CAM buttons in the jog window, to do simple operation using two memorized position.


 <ul>
  <li> <b>RST</b> </li>
  <li> <b>M2A</b> </li>
  <li> <b>M2B</b> </li>
  <li> <b>RMA</b> </li>  
  <li> <b>RMB</b> </li>

</ul>

<h3>Memory buttons</h3>
Left Click on the memory button will make a jog to this position
Right Click on tthe memory button permit to store the position in this memory
and to add some meaningful descriptor to the button and canvas marker tooltips</li>

<h3>Many little improvements in the interface </h3>
<p>The plugin mechanism is wiped out, some code is retained</p>
<p>Optimisation is not active, but hte code is retained just in case</p>
